Hello support team!

There's a Miro Community site that needs you to disable an old
PayPal recurring payment profile. This is because the site admin
downgraded, and we have no way of automatically cancelling the old
recurring payment.

So you have to log into PayPal and disable it.

You're using this email address with PayPal:
    {{ paypal_email_address }}

The old recurring payment profile is:
    {{ old_profile }}

The site has a new subscription now:
    {{ new_profile }}

The new subscription will help it stay in the {{ tier_name }} tier.

Sincerely,

A robot.
