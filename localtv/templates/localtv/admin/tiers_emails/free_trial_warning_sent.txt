Hi, {{ short_name }},

We hope you're enjoying your Miro Community free trial! Here are some suggestions to make your site really shine:

Organize

People will want to visit your video site because they can easily find material
they're looking for. If you follow these guides in the Miro Community manual,
your site will stay fresh and easy to navigate:

* Featuring good content: http://develop.participatoryculture.org/index.php/MiroCommunityManual#Featuring_Videos

* Adding categories: http://develop.participatoryculture.org/index.php/MiroCommunityManual#Categories

* Making playlists: http://develop.participatoryculture.org/index.php/MiroCommunityManual#Playlists


Spread the Word

Ask other websites within your community to add a widget to their sites - they'll
get an influx of community videos and you'll get great exposure.

Build a Community

Encourage users to build their profiles and add videos of their own, if
appropriate. You can look for other relevant videos using the Search
for Videos button on the Manage Sources page.
